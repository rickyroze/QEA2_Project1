# **Shuffler**

## What is Shuffler?
---
> Our project is a wearable sensor which can be used to track the walking and shuffling habits of elderly people and those prone to falling. This device is mounted on the shoe of an elderly person to detect if they are shuffling, 

## Why does this matter?
---
> Shuffling has been known to be a warning sign for many illnesses associated with age, and it also greatly increases the risk of falling, especially on non-level surfaces that are prevalent in homes and the outside. This system is intended to be used by elderly persons to determine if their gait pattern is more akin to shuffling or walking. By creating a threshold based off of data, we can have the device let the user know when they are not walking with a regular gait, and so that they are more aware of their habits of shuffling. This is also useful for caretakers and children of the elderly so that they can be more aware of gait habits as well.

## How Did We Do It?
---
> In order to successfully provide a proof-of-concept for this product, we decided on a selection of two sensors, available in our smartphones for preliminary testing: the accelerometer and the rotation sensors. Since it is less likely for the elderly to have phones on them at all times, we decided to mount our smartphone to our ankle, with the intention that the device would be able to clip onto a shoe and be less cumbersome for the wearer. Once we selected our location of the sensor, we then moved on to the experiment. In testing, we collected data for both walking and shuffling of the same person on the same surface, going the same amount of distance in order to properly be able to analyze the data later. Once this data was collected, we then analyzed the data using the algorithms and motion models we developed for walking versus shuffling.
