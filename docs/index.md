### _Welcome to Jill and Ricky's QEA2 project one hompage!_
 
## What are we doing?
---
> Our project is a wearable sensor which can be used to track the walking and shuffling habits of elderly people and those prone to falling.
## Why are we doing this?
---
> Shuffling can be a warning sign for many illnesses associated with age.  It also greatly increases the risk of falling.  This system is intended to be used after an injury in someone who may be prone to shuffling to determine if their gait pattern is improving or degrading.  With this information, it can be determined wheather or not further medical attention (such as physical therapy) is required.  In this system, we are also planning to integrate fall detection to distinguish between normal activities like sitting, and falling.
