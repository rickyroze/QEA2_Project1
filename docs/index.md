## What is Shuffler?
---
> Our project is a wearable sensor which can be used to track the walking and shuffling habits of elderly people and those prone to falling.

## Why are we doing this?
---
> Shuffling can be a warning sign for many illnesses associated with age.  It also greatly increases the risk of falling.  This system is intended to be used after an injury in someone who may be prone to shuffling to determine if their gait pattern is improving or degrading.  With this information, it can be determined wheather or not further medical attention (such as physical therapy) is required.  In this system, we are also planning to integrate fall detection to distinguish between normal activities like sitting, and falling.

## Motion Model and Sensors
---
> Based off of the ___ paper, we assumed that a motion model for walking would follow the shape of an inverted pendulum, with a sensor attached at the hip. For our purposes, however, as well as our user group, we decided that a sensor placed on the shoe or foot of the wearer would provide us with the best possible data, while being able to best discern between walking and shuffling.
