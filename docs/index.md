## What is Shuffler?
---
> Our project is a wearable sensor which can be used to track the walking and shuffling habits of elderly people and those prone to falling. This device is mounted on the shoe of an elderly person to detect if they are shuffling,

> Shuffling has been known to be a warning sign for many illnesses associated with age, and it also greatly increases the risk of falling, especially on non-level surfaces that are prevalent in homes and the outside.

By creating a threshold based off of data, we can have the device let the user know when they are not walking with a regular gait, and so that they are more aware of their habits of shuffling. This is also useful for caretakers and children of the elderly so that they can be more aware of gait habits as well.
