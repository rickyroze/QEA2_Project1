# **Algorithm Development**

Our method for detecting the difference between walking and shuffling relied on two different types of readings: 
accelerometer and attitude data. 

## Motion Model and Sensors
---
Based off of the ___ paper, we assumed that a motion model for walking would follow the shape of an inverted pendulum, with a sensor attached at the hip. For our purposes, however, as well as our user group, we decided that a sensor placed on the shoe or foot of the wearer would provide us with the best possible data, while being able to best discern between walking and shuffling.

## Next Steps
---
after an injury in someone who may be prone to shuffling to determine if their gait pattern is improving or degrading.  With this information, it can be determined wheather or not further medical attention (such as physical therapy) is required.  In this system, we are also planning to integrate fall detection to distinguish between normal activities like sitting, and falling.
