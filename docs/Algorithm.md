## Motion Model and Sensors
---
> For our purposes, however, as well as our user group, we decided that a sensor placed on the shoe or foot of the wearer would provide us with the best possible data, while being able to best discern between walking and shuffling. This greatly reduced the degrees of freedom that we had to account for, as our original idea was to have the user's phone collect the data; however, it made some of our data more noisy as a result. 

...insert picture here...

As seen in the motion sketches above, there were two major components that seemed the most different between our initial model of shuffling versus our model of walking. First, the vertical (y-axis) movement in walking was one of the critical indicators of walking. In shuffling, it is much less likely for someone to lift their feet to the extent of walking, since it is more of a cautious gait movement. In addition, there seemed to be less of an attitude change or rotation of the ankle (where we were measuring from) 

## Next Steps
---
> To expand this product out more, the next steps for development would be to create a way for the sensor to detect falls, as one of the main reasons falls happen in the elderly is due to shuffling. In addition to this, further iteration of our motion model would be useful in making this a more robust system, and working with our user group to find the best method of data collection would be critical to further development of Shuffler.

> After an injury in someone who may be prone to shuffling to determine if their gait pattern is improving or degrading.  With this information, it can be determined wheather or not further medical attention (such as physical therapy) is required.  In this system, we are also planning to integrate fall detection to distinguish between normal activities like sitting, and falling.
