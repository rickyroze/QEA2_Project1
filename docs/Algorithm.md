# **Algorithm Development**
---
> To expand this product out more, the next steps for development would be to create a way for the sensor to detect falls, as one of the main reasons falls happen in the elderly is due to shuffling. In addition to this, further iteration of our motion model would be useful in making this a more robust system, and working with our user group to find the best method of data collection would be critical to further development of Shuffler.

## Motion Model and Sensors
---
> Based off of the ___ paper, we assumed that a motion model for walking would follow the shape of an inverted pendulum, with a sensor attached at the hip. For our purposes, however, as well as our user group, we decided that a sensor placed on the shoe or foot of the wearer would provide us with the best possible data, while being able to best discern between walking and shuffling.

## Next Steps
---
> After an injury in someone who may be prone to shuffling to determine if their gait pattern is improving or degrading.  With this information, it can be determined wheather or not further medical attention (such as physical therapy) is required.  In this system, we are also planning to integrate fall detection to distinguish between normal activities like sitting, and falling.
